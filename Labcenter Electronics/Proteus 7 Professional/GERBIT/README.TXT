Introduction.
-------------
Gerbit for Windows is a Gerber import tool for the Proteus 
Complete Electronics Design System. The program is supplied 
compressed with Install Shield and should create a new group 
on your start menu. Note that Gerbit is written for 274-D 
format gerber files. Although much of a 274-X file will be 
imported correctly Aperture information and some high level 
commands will be ignored.

Requirements
------------
This version of Gerbit is 32-bit and requires Windows 95 or 
Windows NT 4. A 16 bit version for DOS is available but lacks 
many of the graphical enhancements.

Getting started.
----------------
Gerbit for windows requires information regarding the pad and 
trace styles used in the Proteus system, and these are held in 
a file called default.sty within the Proteus home directory. 
When gerbit is run for the first time you will be asked to locate 
the default.sty file.

Included in the installation is an example Gerbit project based on 
the ARES dbell board.

A tutorial on how to use Gerbit is included in the on-line help and
may be printed as a single topic. it is strongly recommended that you
work through this tutorial prior to using Gerbit for a REAL project.
