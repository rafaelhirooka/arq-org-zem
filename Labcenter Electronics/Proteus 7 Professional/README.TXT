PROTEUS 7.4 README FILE
=======================

PROTEUS RELEASE IDENTIFICATION SCHEME
-------------------------------------
Since PROTEUS consists of many separate programs plus a large number
of additional files (e.g. libraries and models), we have decided
to identify different issues of PROTEUS in terms of a version
number and a service pack number. 

The current service pack number is indicated at the top of this file.
